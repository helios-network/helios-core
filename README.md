Home of the following services:

* [heliades](/cmd/heliades)

## Installation

### Building from sources

In order to build from source youâ€™ll need at least [Go 1.23+](https://golang.org/dl/).

```bash
# need to clone if you plan to run tests, and use Makefile
$ git clone git@github.com:helios-network/helios-core.git
$ cd helios-core
$ make install

# or simply do this to fetch modules and build executables
go install github.com/helios-network/helios-core/cmd/...
```

### Quick Setup

The most convenient way to launch services is by running the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Then run an instance of the heliades node.

```bash
./heliades.sh
```

Voila! You have now successfully setup a full node on the Helios Chain.

More Simply you can (it clean and setup and start node)

```bash
make install-full
```

## Generating the module specification docs

```bash
cd docs && yarn && yarn run serve
```

## Generating REST and gRPC Gateway docs

First, ensure that the `Enable` and `Swagger` values are true in APIConfig set in `cmd/heliades/config/config.go`.

Then simply run the following command to auto-generate the Swagger UI docs.

```bash
make proto-swagger-gen
```

Then when you start the Helios Daemon, simply navigate to [http://localhost:1317/docs](http://localhost:1317/docs).

## Maintenance

To run all unit tests:

```bash
go test ./helios-chain/...
```
